# Traffic_Light_Control_System

The system contains simply two traffic lights. One allows cars to move from north to south, and the other one allows cars to move from east to west. Beside each traffic there is also a pedestrian traffic light. The pedestrian has to press on a button to have his light green to cross the street safely.
